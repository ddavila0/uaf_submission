## Matchmaking
Is the process in wich the attributes and requirements of both jobs and slots are compared in order to find a suitable combination, i.e. a job that is willing to run on a given slot which in turn is willing to run that given job.

In a HTCondor pool this process is carried out by the negotiator during the negotiation cycle.
On the context of GlideinWMS this happens within the Fronted, when it is trying to decide whether to request a given pilot for a given jobs or not.
